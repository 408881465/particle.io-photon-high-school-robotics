# particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics
Most of the important files from my High School Robotics course using the particle.io photon a wifi out of the box arduino.


For advanced students in my High School beginner robotics class to proceed quickly through the course so they can start making prototypes or for beginner students in my advanced Robotics Construction class to go at their own pace through some of the harder assignments.

Hopefully this repository will stay reasonably static so that it matches the video series at

1. [a01-console:](https://youtu.be/chaqZgd_6Vs)  A simple console program to get things started. No webpage needed. outputs A0 to the console. Then uses a GND (black), 3V3 (red) , SIG (yellow) sensor in this case a [slide potentiometer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Slide-Potentiometer-p-1196.html) (variable resitor).

1. [a02-voltage-divider:](https://youtu.be/ARvSD5UfkQE)  Using a voltage divider to better control the output of a 2 prong sensor in this case a [SNAP circuit photoresistor](http://www.elenco.com/product/productdetails/snap_circuits&amp%3Breg_parts=MTAw/photosensitive_resistor=ODE4)

1. [a03-DAC-to-ADC:](https://youtu.be/lFoDp0gJv_g) This program shows how to change a digital signal into and anlog signal and then what happens when that analog signal is read by the analog pin A0 and the digital pin D6 

1. [a04-SOS-programming](https://youtu.be/ZnaCcftdiR0) A short look at programming the particle.io photon by making students control the D7 LED to flash SOS
