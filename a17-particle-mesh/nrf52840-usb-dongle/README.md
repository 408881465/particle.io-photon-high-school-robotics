just trying the codelab and including the files here if they actually work. Only trying to get the credentials set. nothing else


https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/openthread-apis/#0

The default-hex folder has pure unchanged openthread nrf52840 files to flash to the usb dongle.

If those work I will then try to make a hard coded setting of the dtaset credentials.
